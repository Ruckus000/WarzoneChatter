Looking at your code, I see an issue with the authentication flow that's likely causing the infinite loading state after Twitch authentication. Let me analyze what's happening.

The problem appears to be in how the authentication state is being tracked in your client-side application. When a user authenticates with Twitch, the server creates a session, but there seems to be an issue with how the client detects this authenticated state.

Let's fix this with a React component that will solve your infinite loading issue:

Here's what's causing the infinite loading issue:

1. **Session Detection Problem**: After Twitch authentication, the React app loads but fails to detect the authenticated session, leaving your app in a loading state.

2. **Query Client Configuration**: Your query client configuration is set with `staleTime: Infinity`, which means it won't refresh data once fetched, making it hard to detect new authentication state.

To fix this issue:

1. Replace your `client/src/lib/auth.tsx` file with the code from the artifact I created.

2. The key improvements in this fixed version:
   - Added a special check to detect Twitch redirects and force a refetch
   - Changed the stale time to allow refreshing auth state
   - Added better retry logic
   - Added timeout to ensure the server has time to set cookies

3. In your `client/src/lib/queryClient.ts` file, make this small adjustment:

```typescript
export const queryClient = new QueryClient({
  defaultOptions: {
    queries: {
      queryFn: getQueryFn({ on401: "throw" }),
      refetchInterval: false,
      refetchOnWindowFocus: false,
      staleTime: 60000, // Change from Infinity to 60 seconds
      retry: 1,         // Allow one retry
    },
    mutations: {
      retry: false,
    },
  },
});
```

If the issue persists after these changes, you might also check:

1. **Cookie Settings**: Ensure your session cookie settings in `server/index.ts` are correct. The `secure` flag should match your deployment environment (false for HTTP, true for HTTPS).

2. **CORS Issues**: If you're testing in development, make sure your browser isn't blocking cookies due to CORS issues.

3. **Session Debugging**: The server already has some session debugging - check your console logs to see if the session ID is consistent between requests.

These changes should fix the infinite loading issue by properly detecting when authentication has completed and updating the UI accordingly.
